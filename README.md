# electricity_calculator
This project is a PHP-based electricity consumption calculator that computes power, energy, and the total charge based on the current rate. The calculation is based on user input of voltage (V), current (A), and the electricity rate. The program is designed to provide an easy way to calculate electricity costs based on these variables.
